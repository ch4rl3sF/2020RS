	<h2><u>Main Causes</u></h2>

	<p>The Vietnam war was an atrocity of the war, and it was the second Indochinese war. One of the main causes of this war was North Vietnam wanting the entirety of Vietnam to follow under communist rule. This gave way to some major issues in Vietnam as south Vietnam did not agree. The intention was to overthrow the south Vietnamese Government, was led mainly by the communist guerrillas, the Viet Cong and the National Liberation Front, which had the support North Vietnam, which ended up in the war.</p>

	<p>After the French had left southern Vietnam and most of Indochina, the United states chose to support southern Vietnam, as they felt they could gain control. This ideology was opposed by North Vietnam, as they thought that the South Vietnamese should be free from the “colony and exploitation”. This was oddly conflicted, as the US thought that they were saving South Vietnam from the Communism of North Vietnam and china.</p>

	<p>Another cause of this is that it was just before the cold war, which meant that tensions where rising between America and the Soviet Union, as America had the simple belief that communism was spreading through south east Asia. Neither America nor the Soviet could start a war between themselves, because of the ability of the two countries, and their nuclear weapons. However, the two did have client states that could fight on their behalf. As North Vietnam was becoming a communist country, it was perfect for the soviet union to use, as it was a small country, ready to fight for communism beleifs.</p>

	<p>Before World War Two, Vietnam had been part of the French Empire. During the war, the country had been overrun by the Japanese. When the Japanese retreated, the people of Vietnam took the opportunity to establish their own government lead by Ho Chi Minh. However, after the end of the war, the Allies gave back South Vietnam to the French while the north was left in the hands of the non-communist Chinese. The Nationalist Chinese treated the North Vietnamese very badly and support for Ho Chi Minh grew. He had been removed from power at the end of the war. The Chinese pulled out of North Vietnam in 1946 and the party of Ho Chi Minh took over – the Viet Minh.</p>

	<p>In October 1946, the French announced their intention of reclaiming the north which meant that the Viet Minh would have to fight for it. The war started in November 1946, when the French bombarded the port of Haiphong and killed 6,000 people. The French tried to win over the people of the north by offering them "independence". However, the people would not be allowed to do anything without French permission. A new leader of the country was appointed called Bao Dai. The Russians and Eastern Europe refused to recognise his rule. They claimed that Ho Chi Minh was the real ruler of Vietnam.</p>

	<p>The French had got themselves into a difficult military position. Despite huge American help, the French could not cope with the Viet Minh’s guerrilla tactics. The Viet Minh were by now receiving help from Communist China – Mao Zedong had taken power of China in 1949. The fact that two opposing sides had developed was classic Cold War history. The country was
	countries. This election did not take place and the split had become permanent by 1956.</p>
