   <h2><u>Impacts</u></h2>
   <p>The death toll ranges from 3 million to 5 million, plus millions of injured and disabled during the 21-year war. More than 1 million people fled South Vietnam. Vietnam is the most bombed country in the history of the world. The United States attacked South Vietnam with more than 75 million liters of toxic chemicals.</br>
    Launched pumps reach the number of 7 million tons, three times more than the number used in the Second World War.</br>
	The United States had more than 58,000 soldiers killed and 300,000 wounded, half disabled. Many Americans suffered from serious mental disorders called the 'Vietnam Syndrome'. 10% of the soldiers became addicted to heroin in Vietnam. </br>
	Tens of thousands of soldiers contracted cancer or had offspring with birth defects from exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide used to destroy large tracts of jungle. </br>
	The frustration for the war detonated the movement Hippie in the United States that sought to rebel, with an anti-war message, of sexual freedom, peace, equality and love. </br>
	The war left large parts of Vietnam's territory with mined areas that have affected the country's agricultural development.
	The stress of fighting an unseen enemy also took its toll on American troops. They took their anger and frustration out on villages that may or may not have been helping the NLF. The most famous of these took place in an area code-named 'Pinksville' where the villages at My Lai were massacred. This massacre was filmed and the US military had little opportunity to cover it up. It is generally accepted that there were other massacres, probably on a smaller scale, but these were never recorded and would have been viewed as what goes on in warfare.</br>
	However, villages in South Vietnam were very much vulnerable to NLF atrocities. Any village that did not provide the NLF with shelter or food in fear of US retaliation, could expect punishment. This could be the arbitrary execution of the village elder and his family, for example. </p>
